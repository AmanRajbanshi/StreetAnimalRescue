              Street Animal Care is active in more than eight districts across
              the country and provides massive aid to a number of others. Our
              purpose is to have a positive impact on society by changing how we
              think about others and how we connect â€“ changes that are more
              important than ever. Our group also serves as a voice for those
              who have no one else to speak for them.
