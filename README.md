This project is a comprehensive web application that offers a dynamic and interactive user experience. On the front end,
it utilizes React, with React Router for seamless navigation, React Count Up for animated number displays,
and React Share for easy social media sharing. For payment processing, the app integrates Khalti Checkout Web.

On the back end, the project is built on Node.js and Express, providing a robust server-side foundation.
MongoDB serves as the database, ensuring data storage and management. User security is a priority with Bcrypt for password hashing
and JWT for authentication and authorization. CORS is used to control resource access, and Axios facilitates client-server communication.
Meanwhile, Morgan assists with logging, and Nodemailer handles email notifications.

In summary, this web application combines a user-friendly front end with powerful back-end technologies,
offering a secure, feature-rich, and scalable platform for various functionalities, including data storage, 
user authentication, online payments, and email communication.
